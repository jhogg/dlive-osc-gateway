# dlive-osc-gateway
Allen &amp; Heath dLive OSC-like gateway for qLab via AH-NET

## DISCLAIMER

This software talks directly to the dLive system over TCP using Allen & Heath's undocumented AH-NET
protocol.  While the capabilities are siginficantly greater than the MIDI-based interface, it is 
fully unsupported and may cause problems:
* Your system may lock up or perform incorrectly;
* You may cause damage to your hardware, software or saved show;
* You may cause hearing damage;
* You may cause individual hearing damage to IEM users.

The AH-NET protocol does not implement any security or data validation, which can result in invalid
information being sent to the mixer.  

**USE OF THIS SOFTWARE IS FOR EVALUATION PURPOSES ONLY AND AT YOUR OWN RISK**
