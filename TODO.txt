dLive qLab Gatway TODO List

This list is not in any priority order and depends on, ultimately, having access to a MixRack
to do both the research and testing since the protocol is undocumented.

* Work out the log10 formula for fader settings in dB
* Implement front/rear pan for 5.1
* Implement level/mute on sends for input & fx returns
* Implement lfe/enable on main for input & mixes

General:

* Config file & debug levels from command line

To be worked out from protocols:

* Implement support for async-received messages to update states (fader/levels primarily)
* Implement pull for channel/mix names
* Implement pull for fader/level & other initial state
* Find stereo ganging info
* Do we need to subscribe to any of the UDP data or does it all state info show up in TCP async notifications?
* Implement relative changes for fader/level (need dB log scale & read current level first)
* Find/implement FX control


FIXME:

* /channel/*/insert[a|b] work for mono channels, they need to enable/disable both channels for stereo pairs
